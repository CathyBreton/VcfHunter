<li>only variant alleles supported by at least &quot;minimal allele coverage&quot; reads and having a frequency equal or greater to &quot;minimal frequency&quot; in one accession were kept as variant,</li>
<li>sites showing at least one variant allele were kept for variant calling. For each accession and at each variant site, a genotype was called based on the maximum likelihood of all possible genotype calculated based on a binomial distribution assuming a sequencing error rate of 0.005.

If no grouping information the GROUP column is filled with UN value. This grouping value <strong>doesn't have any influence on the analysis</strong>, it only allows to add colors graphs drawn.

<p>This programs aims at performing a chromosome painting of accessions along chromosome based on the allele grouping correponding to the ancestral groups. The idea is to search, for distinct regions (along the chromosomes) of the accession we want to study, the probability of an ancestral origin (homozygous or heterozygous). Because, distinct ancestral groups can contain different specific alleles, show distinct heterozygosity levels and allele fixation (du to distinct reproductive mode for example) such probability is not straightforward. An idea can be to calculate for each regions, the expected ancestral allele grouping proportion (based on ancestral accessions) and compare this value to the observed one. Because dataset can be small and/or representatives of ancestral group are very few, the expected ancestral allele grouping proportion can be difficult to estimate. <br/> This programs solves the problem by simulating ancestral population from accessions identified as representatives of the ancestral groups under panmixie hypothesis. For each ancestral populations a total of 100 individuals were simulated. The same was performed for hybrids between two populations. At the and of this simulation process mean and standard deviation of allele grouping proportions were calculated for each ancestral group on sliding windows of size n overlapping of n-1.<br/> These grouping proportions were then calculated on tested accessions and estimated proportion were used to calculate the ancestry probability as followed.<br/></p>
